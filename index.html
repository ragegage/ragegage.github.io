            <summary>On making a website</summary>
            <p>
              People often ask me about making websites. Instead of trying to
              remember and recollect my thoughts on that topic for each person
              that asks, I‚Äôve decided to write down what I think in one place.
              What follows are some of the things I‚Äôve learned over the past ten
              years of making websites for myself and others in my career as a
              freelancer, as part of a design studio, and as a software
              engineer.
            </p>

            <p>First: design and inspiration.</p>
            <p>
              Having your own ideas is great, but unless you‚Äôd describe yourself
              as a designer, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend designing your own website.
              Instead, look around at websites of people that do similar things
              to you, develop your taste by figuring out what you like and
              dislike about their websites, and use their existing designs as a
              template for your own website. This will make it much easier to
              come up with a website design that is coherent, and it will also
              make it much easier for you to communicate the specifics of the
              website you want to your web developer (or allow you to more
              easily build it yourself).
            </p>

            <p>Second: website structure and hosting.</p>
            <p>
              If you live in the modern world, or listen to podcasts, you‚Äôve
              heard of Squarespace and Wix. That‚Äôs great. They serve a niche in
              website creation, but it‚Äôs probably smaller than what you might
              think. I classify ideas for websites by two things: how often
              they‚Äôll be updated, and how they‚Äôll be updated.
            </p>
            <p>
              Class 1: websites that either will not be updated, or will be
              updated in simple ways (slightly changing copy, adding new entries
              of templated sections). For these websites, all it takes is
              building it once and it‚Äôs pretty much set. Any updates can be done
              by ‚Äúgoing into the code‚Äù (gasp! It‚Äôs actually much simpler than
              you would think) and changing words or straightforwardly copying
              and pasting other bits. These websites can be hosted for free in
              several places (GitHub pages, Netlify, &c.) and the only ongoing
              cost of them is the domain name (~$9/yr).
            </p>
            <p>
              Class 2: websites that will be updated in more complicated ways or
              by people who are uncomfortable with text and prefer to use GUIs
              (graphical user interfaces) or website builder wizards. These
              websites might have blog posts on them, where each blog post has
              its own semi-complicated format, or you might be regularly adding
              pages that are more ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù. This is where Squarespace (or Wix,
              or Wordpress) can be more handy, as they all allow you to
              drag-and-drop images and text into a semi-custom layout. Of
              course, this handiness comes at a cost - these are either ~$10/mo
              (Squarespace, Wix) or free but require server hosting at ~$5/mo
              (Wordpress) - and they‚Äôre always trying to upsell you on themes or
              templates or plugins.
            </p>
            <p>
              Class 3: websites that will be updated in response to user input.
              These are what people call ‚Äúapps,‚Äù and they require a server and a
              database to store and process those user actions. This server can
              either be custom, written by software engineers that you are
              paying (Facebook is an ‚Äúapp,‚Äù for example, with thousands of
              software engineers constantly working on its design and
              functionality), or out-of-the-box (I‚Äôd classify Shopify as an
              ‚Äúapp,‚Äù where their software records and processes user
              interactions with your site). There are ways to do this for cheap,
              but in general building this class of website requires either a
              lot of money or a lot of expertise, or both.
            </p>

            <p>Third: content.</p>
            <p>
              Content is king. If you have interesting content, then show it off
              - write things that are interesting, display pictures that are
              cool, or showcase engaging video content. If you want the same
              people to visit your site over and over again (the way that people
              check Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, or Substack),
              then you‚Äôll need to update it regularly. Getting yourself into a
              routine where you can regularly update your website's content will
              be important. If, however, you care more about rarer visits from
              different people, then you won't need to update your content quite
              so much.

              <summary>Cockroaches, or life on the bottom</summary>
              <p>
                There are two ways to thrive in life, and as counterintuitive as
                it sounds, one of them is to be a cockroach.
              </p>
              <p>
                The obvious way to thrive is to move up the food chain - enmesh
                yourself more in the flows of capital and human activity.
                Accumulate more possessions, hire people and services to service
                those expanded possessions, and finance this expansion by
                selling more (and more valuable things) to more people.
              </p>
              <p>
                But what happens when that chain breaks down? Cargo gets stuck
                in container ships sitting off the coast. Workers lose their
                visas due to a change in foreign policy, and the world faces a
                shortfall of natural gas for heating. The global economy shuts
                down at the drop of a mask. At that point, you‚Äôre left alone in
                an oversized husk of high-maintenance possessions.
              </p>
              <p>
                By reducing your needs, on the other hand, you can future-proof
                yourself against unexpected downturns. This could be your
                lifestyle inputs, your expenses, or your energy demand - or all
                three. The goal in this case is to reduce the flow of energy,
                materials, and capital out of your bubble as much as possible,
                allowing the bubble to sustain itself with no inputs.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a common first step in many FIRE journeys: realize what
                gives meaning to your life and prioritize that ruthlessly. This
                allows you to redirect your newly liberated surplus into
                investments. I‚Äôm not going to weigh in on any particular
                investment strategies in this article - the Bogleheads say that
                simpler is better, while the Bitcoiners preach the gospel of
                DeFi - but I will say that capital investments are investments
                too.
              </p>
              <p>
                Improving your bubble so that it needs fewer inputs is an
                investment. Insulating your house so that you don‚Äôt need to heat
                and cool it so much is an investment. Installing solar panels so
                that you can lessen your dependency on the grid is an
                investment. Planting a garden so you can grow your own food is
                an investment, and so is buying one nice suit that will last
                through every wedding you go to for the rest of your life.

                The USA is different from China. The USA is different from
                Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
                All three of these countries engage in a ton of international
                trade, but in very different ways. The broad strokes of those
                differences starts to explain their differing strategic
                positions.
              </p>
              <p>
                The USA essentially engages with the world to consume. The image
                you have in your head of cargo ships loaded high with plastic
                junk and cheap clothing, headed from Guangzhou to Long Beach, is
                directionally accurate. The USA isn‚Äôt buying the things that
                keep the country afloat, like natural gas, or even oil, much
                less high-tech weaponry from China; in fact, the USA isn‚Äôt
                buying that from anyone. Thanks to the exploitation of North
                America‚Äôs shale natural gas fields, and thanks to all of the
                offshore drilling that keeps the seabirds dying in the Gulf of
                Mexico and off Southern California‚Äôs coast, the USA has been
                energy independent for a while now. The same goes for materiel
                related to national security.
              </p>
              <p>
                China engages with the world to sell. China has built thousands
                of massive factories devoted to producing goods for external
                markets because its internal markets aren‚Äôt fully developed
                (read: people that live in China are too poor to spend $30 on
                plastic Mickey Mouse ears). [in-progress]China needs to keep
                selling abroad (mainly to the US, the only economy big enough to
                consume its output) in order to stay afloat. If spending in the
                US pulls back, China is in big trouble.[/in-progress]
              </p>
              <p>
                [in-progress]Europe has both ends - production (esp. Germany)
                and consumption. Plus, they‚Äôre on the Eurasian supercontinent,
                allowing much greater linkages to form between their economies
                and, say, Russia‚Äôs, or Africa‚Äôs, or the Middle East‚Äôs. This
                positioning, being ‚Äúin the middle of it all,‚Äù means that Europe
                would find it much harder to withdraw from the rest of the world
                and just trade amongst themselves, even if they wanted to. They
                largely don‚Äôt want to, either, for reasons mostly related to
                WWII: from their perspective, global trade ties countries
                together and makes total war less likely. Their commitment to
                trade, as well as their relative lack of natural resources, has
                meant that while Europe is exporting things that other countries
                desperately need in a way that neither the US nor China are
                (e.g., vaccines, weapons), they are importing things that they
                desperately need, like energy (e.g., natural gas from Russia,
                oil from the Middle East) and defense (e.g.,
                NATO).[/in-progress]
              </p>
              <p>
                [in-progress]The USA is a cockroach, barring a worldwide nuclear
                winter. China is desperate for the world‚Äôs (esp. the USA‚Äôs)
                economy to keep growing so that they can continue to sell them
                stuff. Europe must continue to trade, whether it ends up making
                strategic sense for them or not. The USA is the cockroach in
                this scenario, with the most resilience to a global downturn, an
                outbreak of hostilities, or an energy crisis.[/in-progress]

              <summary>Why did Britain's empire collapse</summary>
              <p>Or, the rise of a disinterested superpower</p>
              <p>
                Whenever I listen to the Beatles, I have to keep reminding
                myself that at the time of their global breakthrough, Britain
                still had colonies all over the world. Similarly, when reading
                histories of WWII I have to shake myself out of the classic
                American perspective of Britain as a tiny island nation
                underdog, undergoing an endless siege at the hands of the
                Luftwaffe. This is a true image, but it‚Äôs just as true that this
                was the heart, brain, and purse of the British Empire on which
                ‚Äúthe sun never sets.‚Äù
              </p>
              <p>
                I would argue, and I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs particularly
                controversial, that WWII destroyed the British Empire. This is
                because Germany, in rampaging through Europe, required such a
                diversion of British forces and capital from around the world
                that they could no longer maintain control of their colonies.
                This is also because Japan, in rampaging through the Eastern
                Pacific, required another massive diversion of British forces
                and capital such that the Empire was stretched to its breaking
                point. But I think it is mostly because during this war England
                was supplanted as the leading global power by a country largely
                uninterested in the rest of the world: the United States.
              </p>
              <p>
                While American military buffs love the imagery of D-Day (and,
                less popularly, Iwo Jima), most historians agree that economic
                factors were the main determinants of the outcome. The outcome
                of the war against Japan, for example, was predestined by the
                relative sizes of the two countries‚Äô economies and war engines.
                Japanese military leadership knew that the United States would
                likely triumph in an all-out war, simply because of its size,
                and that was why they chose to attack Pearl Harbor without
                warning - to try and head off American aggression.
              </p>
              <p>
                The war against Germany, more interestingly, was a much more
                equal battle between a large, heavily industrialized Germany and
                a wealthy but small England and a large but quite poor Soviet
                Russia. This war was really won on the Eastern Front, and the
                American Lend-Lease program played no small part in it. From my
                perspective, the United States essentially paid Russia to win
                the European portion of WWII. This was done in order to avoid
                the prospect of a united Europe dominated either by Germany or,
                interestingly enough, by England. The United States was happy to
                encourage a poor backwater like Soviet Russia to control half of
                Europe, because it meant that Europe would be unable to
                challenge the United States. The United States saw an
                opportunity, as the only major party to the war who saw no
                action on its own turf (Pearl Harbor excluded), to seize the
                mantle of world hegemon.
              </p>
              <p>
                What did the United States do with its newfound position?
                Another way of asking this question, with the history of 19th
                and 20th century colonial expansion freshly written, is: why did
                the United States not take control of any colonies, given that
                it was now the world‚Äôs most powerful country?
              </p>
              <p>
                One answer to this is that the United States has a massive,
                largely self-contained economy, and so it can withdraw from the
                world‚Äôs economy without suffering any ill effects. Thus the US
                is unlike many of the previous colonial powers like England,
                Spain, or Japan in that it doesn‚Äôt need to reach abroad for
                other countries to exploit. Following logically from this is the
                suggestion that the United States‚Äô main strategic goal is to
                prevent blocs forming that are big enough to threaten it.
                Frantic discussions over the years about the rise of the USSR,
                the EU, China, India, &c. lend support to this hypothesis. This
                would also imply that the US is not likely to develop any
                colonies, and is in fact likely to encourage colonies to declare
                independence from their oppressors so as to further weaken any
                incumbent powers. This too was borne out, to a certain extent at
                least.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another, more cynical, answer is that the United States was able
                to exploit other countries without explicitly colonializing them
                due to its advanced economy and easy access to capital. This
                hypothesis would suggest that the United States wouldn‚Äôt
                withdraw from the world per se but would instead engage with the
                world in a series of haphazard, relatively short-sighted, and
                corporate-profit-driven actions. The many invasions,
                stabilizations, and withdrawals of other countries that the US
                has made seem to lend credence to this idea. This is
                particularly so if you consider that almost all of those actions
                were taken on behalf of potential leaders who had ties to
                multinational corporate interests and against those who were in
                favor of local national development.

                So in Jordan, in India, in Libya, in Ghana, in Singapore, even
                in Newfoundland, and finally in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom
                eventually became too weak to resist the centripetal forces of
                national self-determination and the claims of other countries.
                Unlike in times past, the new world power was more than happy to
                let the former Empire fracture into pieces without bothering to
                pick up the pieces.
