        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I build fullstack and frontend web apps,
          and I like to have fun with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm a software engineer living in the Bay Area; I currently work at
          <a href='https://joinhonor.com' target='_blank'>Honor</a>, a home care provider based in San Francisco.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I taught full-stack web development at App Academy, delivering lectures, developing new curricula, mentoring students, and managing student projects. I had attended App Academy and was hired as a full-time teaching assistant (TA) directly out of the program.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am comfortable working in Ruby, Javascript, and Python, particularly
          within the frameworks Rails, React, and Redux. I also love learning new things, from Django to Elixir and Phoenix.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before attending App Academy,
          I co-founded
          <a href='https://astroltd.com/' target='_blank'>Astro Limited Picture Company</a>.

        <h3>Stopify</h3>
        <h4>MP3 Player built in Electron and Rails</h4>
        <p>Song metadata are read from .mp3 files and loaded into a local database.
          Title and artist information are stored, as is the path to the file.
          Songs are played, looked up, and put into playlists (including a built-in 'currently playing' queue) using the desktop app, built with Electron.
          File and folder structure is navigated to allow easy importing of big, nested file trees full of songs.

        <h3>Intro to Elixir Workshop</h3>
        <h4>6-hour workshop for experienced developers</h4>
        <p>This 6-hour workshop was created over about eight weeks. The workshop introduces: the basics of Elixir, management of processes and state using OTP, and building an umbrella app and using Phoenix. Each topic's coverage includes both a lecture and a problem set.

        <h3>Chat Umbrella</h3>
        <h4>A simple, authenticated, instant messaging app</h4>
        <p>This messaging app is an umbrella app composed of two separate projects: a chat server, and a web app with basic authentication.
          The chat server allows new "chatrooms" to be created, storing the rooms and their messages in memory.
          The web app uses Phoenix (especially its Channels and Presence features), Ecto (to persist user information), and Guardian (to manage user authentication).
