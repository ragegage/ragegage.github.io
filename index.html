          <summary>On making a website</summary>
          <p>
            People often ask me about making websites. Instead of trying to
            remember and recollect my thoughts on that topic for each person
            that asks, I‚Äôve decided to write down what I think in one place.
            What follows are some of the things I‚Äôve learned over the past ten
            years of making websites for myself and others in my career as a
            freelancer, as part of a design studio, and as a software
            engineer.
          </p>

          <p>First: design and inspiration.</p>
          <p>
            Having your own ideas is great, but unless you‚Äôd describe yourself
            as a designer, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend designing your own website.
            Instead, look around at websites of people that do similar things
            to you, develop your taste by figuring out what you like and
            dislike about their websites, and use their existing designs as a
            template for your own website. This will make it much easier to
            come up with a website design that is coherent, and it will also
            make it much easier for you to communicate the specifics of the
            website you want to your web developer (or allow you to more
            easily build it yourself).
          </p>

          <p>Second: website structure and hosting.</p>
          <p>
            If you live in the modern world, or listen to podcasts, you‚Äôve
            heard of Squarespace and Wix. That‚Äôs great. They serve a niche in
            website creation, but it‚Äôs probably smaller than what you might
            think. I classify ideas for websites by two things: how often
            they‚Äôll be updated, and how they‚Äôll be updated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class 1: websites that either will not be updated, or will be
            updated in simple ways (slightly changing copy, adding new entries
            of templated sections). For these websites, all it takes is
            building it once and it‚Äôs pretty much set. Any updates can be done
            by ‚Äúgoing into the code‚Äù (gasp! It‚Äôs actually much simpler than
            you would think) and changing words or straightforwardly copying
            and pasting other bits. These websites can be hosted for free in
            several places (GitHub pages, Netlify, &c.) and the only ongoing
            cost of them is the domain name (~$9/yr).
          </p>
          <p>
            Class 2: websites that will be updated in more complicated ways or
            by people who are uncomfortable with text and prefer to use GUIs
            (graphical user interfaces) or website builder wizards. These
            websites might have blog posts on them, where each blog post has
            its own semi-complicated format, or you might be regularly adding
            pages that are more ‚Äúdesigned‚Äù. This is where Squarespace (or Wix,
            or Wordpress) can be more handy, as they all allow you to
            drag-and-drop images and text into a semi-custom layout. Of
            course, this handiness comes at a cost - these are either ~$10/mo
            (Squarespace, Wix) or free but require server hosting at ~$5/mo
            (Wordpress) - and they‚Äôre always trying to upsell you on themes or
            templates or plugins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Class 3: websites that will be updated in response to user input.
            These are what people call ‚Äúapps,‚Äù and they require a server and a
            database to store and process those user actions. This server can
            either be custom, written by software engineers that you are
            paying (Facebook is an ‚Äúapp,‚Äù for example, with thousands of
            software engineers constantly working on its design and
            functionality), or out-of-the-box (I‚Äôd classify Shopify as an
            ‚Äúapp,‚Äù where their software records and processes user
            interactions with your site). There are ways to do this for cheap,
            but in general building this class of website requires either a
            lot of money or a lot of expertise, or both.
          </p>

          <p>Third: content.</p>
          <p>
            Content is king. If you have interesting content, then show it off
            - write things that are interesting, display pictures that are
            cool, or showcase engaging video content. If you want the same
            people to visit your site over and over again (the way that people
            check Facebook, Reddit, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, or Substack),
            then you‚Äôll need to update it regularly. Getting yourself into a
            routine where you can regularly update your website's content will
            be important. If, however, you care more about rarer visits from
            different people, then you won't need to update your content quite
            so much.
